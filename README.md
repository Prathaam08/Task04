# Task04
# 📝 Task 4: Logistic Regression Binary Classifier

## 📌 Objective:
To build a binary classification model using Logistic Regression and evaluate it with various performance metrics.

## 📦 Tools Used:
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📊 Dataset:
Used the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset** from Scikit-learn's built-in datasets.

## 📈 Steps:
1. Loaded and explored the dataset.
2. Split data into training and testing sets.
3. Standardized the feature values.
4. Built and trained a Logistic Regression model.
5. Evaluated the model using:
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Precision & Recall
   - ROC-AUC Score and ROC Curve
6. Tuned the decision threshold to see its effect on Precision and Recall.

## 📸 Results:
- Included images for **Confusion Matrix** and **ROC Curve**.
- Model achieved high ROC-AUC score, demonstrating good classification performance.
